        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm Dustin Umphress, an AWS Certified Solutions Architect with over 10 years of experience in IT operations
          and systems administration. I've spent the majority of my career in healthcare IT environments, where I've
          managed everything from Microsoft 365 tenants to multi-terabyte data migrations and workflow automation.</p>

        <p>My path into tech wasn't traditional. I started in medical billing operations in 2015, but quickly found
          myself drawn to the technical side—troubleshooting EMR systems, building SQL reports, and eventually taking on
          full IT administration responsibilities. Over the years, I transitioned from operations into systems
          administration, and more recently, into cloud infrastructure and automation.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
          I build cost-efficient, automated cloud infrastructure with a focus on reliability,
          maintainability, and operational simplicity. My work spanning cloud architecture,
          automation, and <a href="/hallucination-free-medical-compliance-engine/" style="color:inherit;">deterministic
            healthcare AI systems</a> is hands-on from design through support.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong>
            Designing and deploying AWS architectures using services such as EC2, S3, Lambda,
            CloudFront, IAM, and Lightsail. I’ve migrated production websites and applications to
            AWS using planned cutovers to minimize or eliminate downtime, and I’ve built lightweight
            serverless solutions to reduce infrastructure overhead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automation:</strong>
            Building Python-based automation tools, SQL reporting workflows, and integration
            pipelines using platforms like Make.com and n8n. These systems replace manual steps
            such as data entry and reporting, improving efficiency and reducing operational friction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Microsoft 365 Administration:</strong>
            Administering Microsoft 365 environments, including Entra ID (Azure AD), MFA enforcement,
            conditional access policies, and user lifecycle management. I’ve also led file storage
            migrations from Dropbox to SharePoint and OneDrive with custom permission structures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure Optimization:</strong>
            Evaluating existing IT and cloud environments to identify waste, simplify architectures,
            and right-size resources. Through targeted optimizations and cloud migrations, I’ve helped
            organizations achieve major cost reductions and more predictable operating expenses.

        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
        <p>I'm actively pursuing opportunities in cloud engineering, DevOps, and infrastructure automation. I recently
          earned my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification (December 2025) and am continuing to build
          hands-on experience through personal projects and infrastructure work.</p>

        <p>My goal is to transition fully into cloud-focused roles where I can apply my operational experience and
          technical skills to build scalable, resilient infrastructure. I'm particularly interested in companies that
          value practical problem-solving and cost-conscious engineering.</p>

        <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
        <p>I'm based in Denton, Texas, and open to remote opportunities nationwide. If you're looking for someone who
          can build reliable infrastructure, automate operational workflows, and approach problems with both technical
          depth and business awareness, I'd love to talk.</p>
